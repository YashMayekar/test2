I don't see any duplicates in this code. Each class, function, and enum member is defined once.

Could you clarify what duplicates you'd like removed? For example:
- Are there duplicate imports?
- Duplicate method definitions?
- Duplicate enum values?
- Or should this code be compared against another file?
